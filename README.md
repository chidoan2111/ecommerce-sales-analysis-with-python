# E-Ccommerce Sales Analysis with Python

In this project, I used Python, specifically the pandas and matplotlib libraries, to answer various business questions for a UK-based e-commerce company that sells unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset contains all transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011.

The project starts with data cleanup and augmentation with additional columns, followed by answers to a series of questions including:
<li>Which country had the highest number of sales?
<li>Which month had the highest sales? How much was earned that month?
<li>What time should we display ads to optimize conversion?
<li>Which product sold the most?
<li>What products are often sold together?
<li>Who are the top spending customers?

The primary goal is to provide this e-commerce business with fundamental insights into their business performance along with recommendations for further initiatives that can bring high-impact results and greater customer satisfaction.

Data source: Kaggle.
